ECE 6745 Tutorial 5: ASIC Standard Cells
==========================================================================

A standard-cell library is a collection of combinational and sequential
logic gates that adhere to a standardized set of logical, electrical, and
physical policies. For example, all standard cells are usually the same
height, include pins that align to a predetermined vertical and
horizontal grid, include power/ground rails and nwells in predetermined
locations, and support a predetermined number of drive strengths. A
standard-cell-based ASIC toolflow involves using automated tools to
transform register-transfer-level (RTL) designs into placed and routed
standard cells on a chip. This tutorial will explore the specific
standard-cell library we will use in this course along with the various
"views" of the standard-cell library. This tutorial assumes you have
already completed the tutorials on Linux, Git, and Verilog.

The first step is to access `ecelinux`. Use VS Code to log into a
specific `ecelinux` server and then use Microsoft Remote Desktop to log
into the same server. Once you are at the `ecelinux` prompt, source the
setup script, source the GUI setup script, clone this repository from
GitHub, and define an environment variable to keep track of the top
directory for the project.

```bash
% source setup-ece6745.sh
% source setup-gui.sh
% mkdir -p $HOME/ece6745
% cd $HOME/ece6745
% git clone git@github.com:cornell-ece6745/ece6745-tut05-asic-stdcells tut05
% cd tut05
% TOPDIR=$PWD
```

1. FreePDK45 Process Design Kit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before you can gain access to a standard-cell library, you need to gain
access to a "physical design kit" (PDK). A PDK includes all of the design
files required for full-custom circuit design for a specific technology.
So this will include a design-rule manual as well as SPICE circuit models
for transistors and other devices. Gaining access to a real PDK is
difficult. It requires negotiating with the foundry and signing multiple
non-disclosure agreements. So in this course we will be using the
FreePDK45 PDK:

 - <https://eda.ncsu.edu/freepdk/freepdk45>

This is an open PDK for a "fake" technology. It was created by
universities using publically available data on several different
commercial 45nm processes. This means you cannot actually tapeout a chip
using this PDK, but the technology is representative enough to provide
reasonable area, energy, and timing estimates for research and teaching
purposes. You can find the FreePDK45 PDK installed here:

```bash
% cd ${ECE6745_INSTALL}/adks/freepdk-45nm/pkgs/FreePDK45-1.4
```

2. NanGate Standard-Cell Library
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A standard-cell designer will use the PDK to implement the standard-cell
library. A standard-cell designer will usually create a high-level
behavioral specification (in Verilog), circuit schematics (in SPICE), and
the actual layout (in `.gds` format) for each logic gate. The
standard-cell-based ASIC tools do not actually use these low-level
implementations, since they are actually _too_ detailed. Instead these
tools use _abstract views_ of the standard cells, which capture logical
functionality, timing, geometry, and power usage at a much higher level.

Just like with a PDK, gaining access to a real standard-cell library is
difficult. It requires gaining access to the PDK first, negotiating with
a company which makes standard cells, and usually signing more
non-disclosure agreements. In this course, we will be using the Nangate
45nm standard-cell library which is based on the open FreePDK45 PDK.

Nangate is a company which makes a tool to automatically generate
standard-cell libraries, so they have made this library publically
available a way to demonstrate their tool. Since it is an open library it
is a great resource for research and teaching. Even though the
standard-cell library is based on a "fake" 45nm PDK, the library provides
a very reasonable estimate of a real commercial standard library in a
real 45nm technology. In this section, we will take a look at both the
low-level implementations and high-level views of the Nangate
standard-cell library.

A standard-cell library distribution can contain gigabytes of data in
thousands of files. For example, here is the distribution for the Nangate
standard-cell library.

```
% cd ${ECE6745_INSTALL}/adks/freepdk-45nm/pkgs/NangateOpenCellLibrary_PDKv1_3_v2010_12
```

To simplify using the Nangate standard-cell library in this course, we
have created a much smaller set of well-defined symlinks which point to
just the key files we want to use in this course. We call this collection
of symlinks an "ASIC design kit" (ADK). Here is the directory which
contains these symlinks.

```
% cd ${ECE6745_STDCELLS}
% ls
pdk-models.sp          # spice models for transistors

rtk-stream-out.map     # gds layer map
rtk-tech.lef           # interconnect technology information
rtk-tech.tf            # interconnect technology information
rtk-typical.captable   # interconnect technology information

stdcells.spi           # circuit schematics for each cell
stdcells.gds           # layout for each cell
stdcells.v             # behavioral specification for each cell

stdcells-lpe.spi       # circuit schematics with parasitics for each cell
stdcells.lib           # abstract logical, timing, power view for each cell (typical)
stdcells-bc.lib        # best case .lib
stdcells-wc.lib        # worst case .lib
stdcells.lef           # abstract physical view for each cell

stdcells.db            # binary compiled version of .lib file
stdcells.mwlib         # Milkyway database built from .lef file

stdcells-databook.pdf  # standard-cell library databook

klayout.lyp            # layer settings for Klayout
```

A standard-cell library will always include a databook, which is a
document that describes the details of every cell in the library. Take a
few minutes to browse through the Nangate standard-cell library databook
located on the course webpage here:

 - <https://web.csl.cornell.edu/courses/ece6745/resources/nangate-freepdk45nm-stdcell-databook.pdf>

### 2.1. Verilog Behavioral View

Let's begin by looking at the Verilog behavioral view for a 3-input NAND
standard cell which is named NAND3_X1.

```
% less -p NAND3_X1 ${ECE6745_STDCELLS}/stdcells.v
module NAND3_X1 (A1, A2, A3, ZN);
  input A1;
  input A2;
  input A3;
  output ZN;

  not(ZN, i_8);
  and(i_8, i_9, A3);
  and(i_9, A1, A2);

  specify
    (A1 => ZN) = (0.1, 0.1);
    (A2 => ZN) = (0.1, 0.1);
    (A3 => ZN) = (0.1, 0.1);
  endspecify

endmodule
```

Note that the Verilog implementation of the 3-input NAND standard cell
looks nothing like the Verilog we used in ECE 4750. This cell is
implemented using Verilog primitive gates (e.g., `not`, `and`) and it
includes a `specify` block which is used for advanced gate-level
simulation with back-annotated delays.

Let's use `iverilog` to simulate the Verilog behavorial view of the
3-input NAND standard cell. Take a look at the provided Verilog test
bench.

```bash
% cd $TOPDIR
% cat nand3-test.v
```

The test bench looks as follows.

```verilog
`include "/classes/ece6745/install/adks/freepdk-45nm/stdview/stdcells.v"

module top();

  logic a;
  logic b;
  logic c;
  logic y;

  NAND3_X1 nand3( a, b, c, y );

  initial begin
    $dumpfile("nand3-test.vcd");
    $dumpvars;

    a = 0; b = 0; c = 0;
    #10;
    $display( "a=%b, b=%b, c=%b, y=%b", a, b, c, y );

    a = 1; b = 1; c = 1;
    #10;
    $display( "a=%b, b=%b, c=%b, y=%b", a, b, c, y );

    a = 0; b = 1; c = 0;
    #10;
    $display( "a=%b, b=%b, c=%b, y=%b", a, b, c, y );

    a = 1; b = 1; c = 1;
    #10;
    $display( "a=%b, b=%b, c=%b, y=%b", a, b, c, y );

  end

endmodule
```

The test bench simply tries four different combinations of input values.
Run the simulation and view the result using Surfer.

```bash
% cd $TOPDIR/sim
% iverilog -g2012 -s top -o nand3-test nand3-test.v
% ./nand3-test
% code nand3-test.vcd
```

The waveforms should look similar to what is shown below. Because this is
a Verilog behavioral view all signals change immediately without any kind
of delay.

### 2.2. SPICE Schematic View

Now that we understand the Verilog behavioral view, let's look at how we
would implement this same standard cells at the transistor level. We can
look at the SPICE schematic view for a 3-input NAND cell (NAND3_X1).

```
% less -p NAND3_X1 ${ECE6745_STDCELLS}/stdcells.spi
.SUBCKT NAND3_X1 A1 A2 A3 ZN VDD VSS
*.PININFO A1:I A2:I A3:I ZN:O VDD:P VSS:G
*.EQN ZN=!((A1 * A2) * A3)
M_i_2 net_1 A3 VSS   VSS NMOS_VTL W=0.415000U L=0.050000U
M_i_1 net_0 A2 net_1 VSS NMOS_VTL W=0.415000U L=0.050000U
M_i_0 ZN    A1 net_0 VSS NMOS_VTL W=0.415000U L=0.050000U
M_i_5 ZN    A3 VDD   VDD PMOS_VTL W=0.630000U L=0.050000U
M_i_4 VDD   A2 ZN    VDD PMOS_VTL W=0.630000U L=0.050000U
M_i_3 ZN    A1 VDD   VDD PMOS_VTL W=0.630000U L=0.050000U
.ENDS
```

For students with a circuits background, there should be no surprises
here, and for those students with less circuits background we will cover
basic static CMOS gate design later in the course. Essentially, this
schematic includes three NMOS transistors arranged in series in the
pull-down network, and three PMOS transistors arranged in parallel in the
pull-up network. The PMOS transistors are larger than the NMOS
transistors (see `W=` parameter) because the mobility of holes is less
than the mobility of electrons.

Let's use ngspice to simulate the SPICE schematic view of the 3-input
NAND standard cell. Take a look at the provided SPICE test bench.

```bash
% cd $TOPDIR/sim
% cat nand3-test.sp
```

Although it is not too important for you to understand how to write a
SPICE test bench, it can still be fun to look at one.

```
* Simple NAND3_X1 simulation

.model dac_b dac_bridge (out_low=0V out_high='VDD' t_rise=0.2ns t_fall=0.2ns)

Ac [b_] [b] dac_c
.model dac_c dac_bridge (out_low=0V out_high='VDD' t_rise=0.2ns t_fall=0.2ns)

run
set color0=white
set color1=black
set color2=red
set xbrushwidth=2
plot V(a) V(b) V(c) V(y)
.endc

.end
```

See Tutorial 8 for much more detail on SPICE simulation. You can run the
simulation using ngspice like this:

```bash
% cd $TOPDIR/sim
% ngspice nand3-test.sp
```

Note that if we use ngspice to display plots, then it is a Linux GUI
application so you will need to use Microsoft Remote Desktop. The
waveforms should look similar to what is shown below. The input signals
ramp up and down based on the `t_rise` and `t_fall` parameters above.
Because this is a SPICE schematic view you can see the output does not
change instantly but instead takes some amount of time due to the
parasitic resistance and capacitances associated with the transistors in
the schematic.

![](img/tut05-nand3-spice-waveforms.png)

### 2.3. GDS Layout View

Now that we understand the SPICE schematic view, let's look at the actual
layout for the 3-input NAND cell using the open-source Klayout GDS
viewer. Note that since Klayout is a Linux GUI application you will need
to use Microsoft Remote Desktop.

```
% klayout -l ${ECE6745_STDCELLS}/klayout.lyp ${ECE6745_STDCELLS}/stdcells.gds
```

Note that we are using the `.lyp` file which is a predefined layer color
scheme that makes it easier to view GDS files. To view the 3-input NAND
cell, find the NAND3_X1 cell in the left-hand cell list, and then choose
_Display > Show as New Top_ from the menu. Here is a picture of the
layout for this cell.

![](img/tut05-nangate45nm-nand3x1-gds.png)

Diffusion is green, polysilicon is red, contacts are solid dark blue,
metal 1 (M1) is blue, and the nwell is the large gray rectangle over the
top half of the cell. All standard cells will be the same height and have
the nwell in the same place. Notice the three NMOS transistors arranged
in series in the pull-down network, and three PMOS transistors arranged
in parallel in the pull-up network. The power rail is the horizontal
strip of M1 at the top, and the ground rail is the horizontal strip of M1
at the bottom. All standard cells will have the power and ground rails in
the same place so they will connect via abutment if these cells are
arranged in a row. Although it is difficult to see, the three input pins
and one output pin are labeled squares of M1, and these pins are arranged
to be on a predetermined grid.

### 2.4. SPICE Extracted Schematic View

The SPICE schematic view was saw earlier includes just the transistors.
We can use sophisticated tools to extract detailed parasitic resistance
and capacitance values from the layout, and then we can add these
parasitics to the circuit schematic to create a much more accurate model
for experimenting with the circuit timing and power. Let's look at a
snippet of the extracted circuit for the 3-input NAND cell:

```
% less -p NAND3_X1 ${ECE6745_STDCELLS}/stdcells-lpe.spi
.SUBCKT NAND3_X1 VDD VSS A3 ZN A2 A1
*.PININFO VDD:P VSS:G A3:I ZN:O A2:I A1:I
*.EQN ZN=!((A1 * A2) * A3)

C_x_PM_NAND3_X1%VDD_c6 N_VDD_M0_s           VSS 3.64134e-17
...
.ENDS
```

The full model is a couple of hundred lines long, so you can see how
detailed this model is!

### 2.5. LIB Logical View

The ASIC tools do not actually interact with the low-level SPICE
schematic views and GDS layour views. We can use a special set of tools
to create a much higher level abstract view of the timing and power of
this circuit suitable for use by the ASIC tools. Essentially, these tools
run many, many circuit-level simulations to create characterization data
stored in a `.lib` (Liberty) file. Let's look at snippet of the `.lib`
file for the 3-input NAND cell.

```
% less -p NAND3_X1 ${ECE6745_STDCELLS}/stdcells.lib

}
```

This is just a small subset of the information included in the `.lib`
file for this cell. We will talk more about the details of such `.lib`
files later in the course, but you can see that the `.lib` file contains
information about area, leakage power, capacitance of each input pin,
logical functionality, and timing. Units for all data is provided at the
top of the `.lib` file. In this snippet you can see that the area of the
cell is 1.064 square micron and the leakage power is 18.1nW. The
capacitance for the input pin `A1` is 1.59fF, although there is
additional data that captures how the capacitance changes depending on
whether the input is rising or falling. The output pin `ZN` implements
the logic equation `!((A1 & A2) & A3)` (i.e., a three-input NAND gate).
Data within the `.lib` file is often represented using one- or
two-dimensional lookup tables (i.e., a `values` table). You can see two
such tables in the above snippet.

Let's start by focusing on the first table. This table captures the delay
from input pin `A1` to output pin `ZN` as a function of two parameters:
the input transition time (horizontal direction in lookup table) and the
load capacitance (vertical direction in lookup table). Note that this
delay is when `ZN` is "falling" (i.e., when it is transitioning from high
to low). There is another table for the delay when `ZN` is rising, and
there are additional tables for every input. Gates are slower when the
inputs take longer to transition and/or when they are driving large
output loads. Each entry in the lookup table reflects characterization of
one or more detailed circuit-level simulations. So in this example the
delay from input pin `A1` to output pin `ZN` is 16ps when the input
transition rate is 4.7ps and the output load is 1.82fF. This level of
detail can enable very accurate static timing analysis of our designs.

Let's now focus on the second table. This table captures the internal
power, which is the power consumed within the gate itself, again as a
function of two paramers: the input transition time (horizontal direction
in lookup table) and the load capacitance (vertical direction in lookup
table). Each entry in the lookup table is calculated by measuring the
current drawn from the power supply during a detailed SPICE simulation
and _subtracting_ any current used to charge the output load. In other
words all of the energy that is _not_ consumed charging up the output
load is considered internal energy. Note that sometimes the internal
power is negative. This is simply due to how we account for energy. We
can either assume all energy is consumed only when the output node is
charged and no energy is consumed when the output node is discharged,
_or_ we can assume half the energy is consumed when the output is node is
charged and half the energy is consumed when the output node is
discharged in which case you will sometimes see negative internal power.

Note that some of the ASIC tools actually do not use the `.lib` file
directly, but instead use a pre-compiled binary version of the `.lib`
file stored in `.db` format. The binary `.db` file is usually much more
compact that the text `.lib` file. The `.lib` file captures the abstract
logical, timing, and power aspects of the standard-cell library, but it
does not capture the physical aspects of the standard-cell library.

### 2.6. LEF Physical View

While the ASIC tools could potentially use the `.gds` file directly, the
ASIC tools do not really need this much detail. We can use a special set
of tools to create a much higher level abstract view of the physical
aspects of the cell suitable for use by the ASIC tools. These tools
create `.lef` files. Let's look at snippet of the the `.lef` file for the
3-input NAND cell.

```

END NAND3_X1
```

This is just a small subset of the information included in the `.lef`
file for this cell. You can see the `.lef` file includes information on
the dimensions of the cell and the location and dimensions of both
power/ground and signal pins. The file also includes information on
"obstructions" (or blockages) indicated with a `OBS` entry. Take a look
at the NAND4_X4 gate to see an obstruction. These are regions of the cell
which should not be used by the ASIC tools. For example, if a cell needs
to use metal 2 (M2), it would create a blockage on M2 so that the ASIC
tools know not to route any M2 wires in that area. You can use Klayout to
view `.lef` files as well.

```
% klayout ${ECE6745_STDCELLS}/stdcells.lef
```

Here is a picture of the `.lef` for the 3-input NAND gate.

If you compare the `.lef` to the `.gds` you can see that the `.lef` is a
much simpler representation that only captures the boundary, pins, and
obstructions.

### 2.7. Routing Technology Files

The standard-cell library also includes several files (e.g.,
`rtk-tech.tf`, `rtk-tech.lef`, `rtk-typical.captable`) that capture
information about the metal interconnect including the wire width, pitch,
and parasitics. For example, let's take a look at the `.captable` file:

```
% less -p M1 ${ECE6745_STDCELLS}/rtk-typical.captable
LAYER M1
  MinWidth              0.07000
  MinSpace              0.06500
  Height                0.37000
  Thickness             0.13000
  TopWidth              0.07000
  BottomWidth           0.07000
  WidthDev              0.00000
  Resistance            0.38000
END

```

This file contains information about the minimum dimenisions of wires on
M1 and the resistance of these wires. It also contains a table of wire
capacitances with different rows for different wire widths and spacings.
The ASIC tools can use this kind of technology information to optimize
and analyze the design.

3. To Do On Your Own
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Great ASIC designers spend time getting to know their standard cell
library. Spend some time exploring other important standard cells in the
NanGate standard cell library. We recommend you look at:

 - NAND3_X2: Three-input NAND gate with 2x drive strength
 - NAND3_X4: Three-input NAND gate with 4x drive strength
 - MUX2_X1: Two-input 1-bit multiplexor
 - INV_X1: Inverter
 - FA: 1-bit full adder
 - DFF_X1: D flip-flop

Compare the GDS layout views and LIB logic views for the three different
three-input NAND gates each with a different drive strength. Look at the
SPICE schematic view to see if you can figure out how the MUX2 gate is
implemented at the transistor level (i.e., try to draw a transistor-level
schematic diagram). Compare the complexity of the full adder and D
flip-flop to a basic inverter by looking at the Verilog behavioral views
and the GDS layout.
