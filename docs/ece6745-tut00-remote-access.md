Tutorial 0: ECE Linux Server Remote Access
==========================================================================

All of the projects for this course will be completed by remotely logging
into a cluster of `ecelinux` servers. The `ecelinux` servers all run the
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 operating system, and they all use an
identical setup. You do not need to do anything special to create an
`ecelinux` account. You will be using your NetID and Cornell password to
login, and an `ecelinux` account will be automatically created for you
when you first login. Any student enrolled in any ECE class should
automatically be granted access to the `ecelinux` servers. Having said
this, if you cannot log into the `ecelinux` servers please reach out to
the course staff for assistance.

Later tutorials will discuss how to use the Linux development environment
and the Git distributed version control system. In this tutorial, we
focus on how to setup remote access to the `ecelinux` servers by first
connecting to the Cornell VPN and then using three different options to
remotely access the `ecelinux` servers. The first remote access option is
based on using PowerShell (for Windows OS users) or Mac Terminal (for Mac
OS X users) and only supports primitive text-based interaction. We
recommend using PowerShell or Mac Terminal as backup options to debug
connection issues to the `ecelinux` servers. The second (and primary)
remote access option recommended in this course is through Visual Studio
Code (VS Code) which provides a very nice interface with support for
working at the command line, graphic text editing, and graphic file
browsing. The third remote access option is based on using Microsoft
Remote Desktop and is required when executing a Linux application with a
graphical user interface.

1. Select an `ecelinux` Server
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to keep in mind that we will use `ecelinux` as shorthand
for the entire cluster of 20 servers. These servers are named as follows:

 - `ecelinux-01.ece.cornell.edu`
 - `ecelinux-02.ece.cornell.edu`
 - `ecelinux-03.ece.cornell.edu`
 - ...
 - `ecelinux-18.ece.cornell.edu`
 - `ecelinux-19.ece.cornell.edu`
 - `ecelinux-20.ece.cornell.edu`

At the beginning of the semester, **select a server and always use that
same server.** Do not just log into `ecelinux.ece.cornell.edu`. Continue
to always use the same server unless you have trouble logging in in which
case you can try switching to a different server.

All of the `ecelinux` servers are identical. Every tool is available on
every `ecelinux` server. All of your files are available on every
`ecelinux` server.

2. Connecting to the Cornell VPN
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are logging into the `ecelinux` servers from on campus (i.e.,
using the Cornell wired or wireless network), then you do not need to
enable the Cornell virtual private network (VPN). However, if you are off
campus, then you will need to enable the Cornell VPN whenever you want to
log into the `ecelinux` servers. The VPN provides very secure access to
all on-campus network resources. More information about the Cornell VPN
is available here:

 - <https://it.cornell.edu/cuvpn>

Simply follow the instructions at the following link to install the Cisco
VPN software for the appropriate operating system you use on your
laptop/workstation:

 - <https://it.cornell.edu/landing-page-kba/2605/5273>

Once the Cornell VPN is installed, then connect to the Cornell VPN by
following these instructions and using your Cornell NetID and password:

 - <https://it.cornell.edu/landing-page-kba/2605/823>

The Cornell VPN uses the Cisco Secure Client shown below.

3. Remote Access via PowerShell or Mac Terminal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

PowerShell is part of Windows OS and Mac Terminal is part of Mac OS X.
Both enable interacting with your system from the command line (i.e., a
powerful text-based environment where users type commands to manipulate
files and directories and execute applications). Both also enable
remotely accessing other systems (e.g., the `ecelinux` servers) via the
command line using SSH, a highly secure network protocol and associated
client/server program. Both will enable you to log into the `ecelinux`
servers and to then manipulate files and directories and execute
applications remotely on the `ecelinux` servers using the Linux command
line. **You must try logging in using PowerShell or Mac Terminal before
attempting to use VS Code!**

### 3.1. Starting PowerShell or Mac Terminal

First, if you are off campus, then you must be connected to the Cornell
VPN before attempting to use X2Go to access the `ecelinux` servers (see
Section 1). To start PowerShell click the _Start_ menu then search for
_Windows PowerShell_. To start Mac Terminal go to your _Applications_
folder and choose _Utilities > Terminal_, or open Spotlight, type
_Terminal_, and press enter.

### 3.2. Logging into `ecelinux` Servers with PowerShell or Mac Terminal

After starting PowerShell or Mac Terminal, type in the following command
at the prompt to log into the `ecelinux` servers using SSH.

```bash
% ssh netid@ecelinux-XX.ece.cornell.edu
```

Replace `netid` with your Cornell NetID in the command above and replace
`XX` with the number of `ecelinux` server you plan to use this semester.
You should not enter the `%` character. We use the `%` character to
indicate what commands we should enter on the command line. Executing the
command will prompt you to enter your Cornell NetID password, and then
you should be connected to the `ecelinux` servers.

The very first time you log into the `ecelinux` servers you may see a
warning like this:

```
The authenticity of host ’ecelinux-XX.ece.cornell.edu (128.253.51.206)’
can’t be established. ECDSA key fingerprint is
SHA256:smwMnf9dyhs5zW5I279C5oJBrTFc5FLghIJMfBR1cxI.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

The very first time you log into the `ecelinux` servers it is okay to
enter _yes_, but from then on if you continue to receive this warning
please contact the course staff.

Once you have opened a terminal, the very first thing you need to do
after logging into the `ecelinux` servers is source the course setup
script. This will ensure your environment is setup with everything you
need for working on the projects. Enter the following command on the
command line:

```bash
% source setup-ece6745.sh
```

Again, you should not enter the `%` character. You should now see a blue
`ECE 6745` in your prompt which means your environment is setup for the
course. See the final section of this tutorial for more on how to
automatically source the setup script every time you log into the
`ecelinux` servers.

You can log out of the `ecelinux` server with the `exit` command.

```bash
% exit
```

**Try logging in, sourcing the setup script, and loging out multiple
times using PowerShell or Mac Terminal. You must make sure you can do
this successfully before attempting to setup VS Code!**

### 3.3. Troubleshooting Remote Access via PowerShell or Mac Terminal

If you cannot source the setup script it might be because you either took
a course in a previous semester which used `ecelinux` or you are
currently taking a course which also uses `ecelinux` _and_ you modified
your `.bashrc` to automatically source the other course's setup script.

You should only source a setup script for a single course at a time. If
you modified your `.bashrc` to source a course setup script you need to
remove those lines from your `.bashrc`. If you are taking two courses
which use `ecelinux` in the same semester then you should make sure _not_
to source either setup script in your `.bashrc`. You should instead
always source the appropriate setup script each time you log into
`ecelinux` for whatever course you are currently working on.

You can use the simple `nano` text editor to edit your `.bashrc` like
this:

```bash
% nano .bashrc
```

Notice that the editor specifies most of the useful commands at the
bottom of the terminal screen. The symbol `\^` indicates the `CONTROL`
key. To type any text you want, just move the cursor to the required
position and use the keyboard. To save your changes press `CONTROL+O1
(i.e., press the `CONTROL1 key and the `O1 key at the same time) and
press the `<ENTER>1 key after specifying the filename you want to save
to. You can quit by pressing `CONTROL+X1. Use `CONTROL+G1 for help.

![](img/tut00-nano.png#border)

Delete every line which sets up `ecelinux` for any course. A pristine
`.bashrc` should look like this:

```
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
  . /etc/bashrc
fi

if ! [[ "$PATH" =~ "$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:" ]]
then
    PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:$PATH"
fi
export PATH
```

**Log out, log in, source the setup script, and log out multiple times
using PowerShell or Mac Terminal. You must make sure you can do this
successfully before attempting to setup VS Code!**

4. Remote Access via VS Code
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

While it is possible to use simple text editors directly within
PowerShell or Mac Terminal, it is not the most productive development
setup. We strongly recommend using VS Code as your primary remote access
option for code development. VS Code offers a nice balance of productive
features while also working well with moderate internet speeds.

VS Code uses a unique approach where the GUI interface runs completely on
your local laptop/workshop and then automatically handles copying files
back and forth between your local laptop/workshop and the `ecelinux`
servers. VS Code is portable across many operating systems and has a
thriving ecosystem of extensions and plugins enabling it to function as a
full-featured IDE for languages from C to Javascript. More information
about VS Code is here:

 - <https://code.visualstudio.com>
 - <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs>

### 4.1. Installing VS Code on Your Laptop/Workstation

You can download VS Code by simply going to the main VS Code webpage:

 - <https://code.visualstudio.com>

There should be an obvious link that says ``Download for Windows'' or
``Download for MacOS''. Click on that link. On Mac OS X, you will need to
drag the corresponding _Visual Student Code.app_ to your _Applications_
folder.

### 4.2. Starting and Configuring VS Code

First, if you are off campus, then you must be connected to the Cornell
VPN before attempting to use VS Code to access the `ecelinux` servers
(see Section 1). Start by opening VS Code. The exact way you do this will
depend on whether you are using a Windows OS or Mac OS X
laptop/workstation.

The key to VS Code is installing the correct extensions. You will need
extensions for the Verilog hardware description language (HDL), the
Python programming language, and the C/C++ programming language. We also
want to install a special extension which will enable remotely accessing
the `ecelinux` servers using SSH. Choose _View > Extensions_ from the
menubar. Enter the name of the extension in the ``Search Extensions in
Marketplace'' and then click the blue \IT{Install} button. Here are the
names of the extensions to install:

 - Remote - SSH (use the one from Microsoft)
 - Verilog (use the one from Masahiro Hiramori)
 - Python (use the one from Microsoft)
 - C/C++ (use the one from Microsoft)
 - Surfer (use the one from surfer-project)

![](img/tut00-vscode-remote-ssh.png)

![](img/tut00-vscode-verilog.png)

![](img/tut00-vscode-python.png)

![](img/tut00-vscode-cpp.png)

![](img/tut00-vscode-surfer.png)

### 4.3. Logging into `ecelinux` Servers with VS Code

After starting VS Code, choose _View > Command Palette_ from the menubar.
Enter the following command in the command palette:

    Remote-SSH: Connect Current Window to Host...

Do not use _Remote-SSH: Add new SSH host..._ and do not use _Connect to
Host_. Use _Remote-SSH: Connect Current Window to Host..._

VS Code will then ask you to _Select configured SSH host or enter
user@host_, and you should enter the following:

    netid@ecelinux-XX.ece.cornell.edu

Replace `netid` with your Cornell NetID in the command above and replace
`XX` with the number of `ecelinux` server you plan to use this semester.
If you are on a Windows OS laptop/workstation, then you may see a pop-up
which stays that the _Windows Defender Firewall as blocked some features
of this app_. This is not a problem. Simply click _Cancel_.

You might also see a drop down which asks you to choose the operating
system of the remote server with options like _Linux_ and _Windows_.
Choose _Linux_.

Finally, the very first time you log into the `ecelinux` servers you
may see a warning like this:

    "ecelinux-XX.ece.cornell.edu" has fingerprint
    "SHA256:YCh2FiadeTXEzuSkC0AOdglBgPciwc8WvcCPncvr2Fs"
    Are you sure you want to continue?
    Continue
    Cancel

The very first time you log into the `ecelinux` servers it is okay to
enter _yes_, but from then on if you continue to receive this warning
please contact the course staff.

Hopefully, VS Code will now prompt you to enter your Cornell NetID
password, and then you should be connected to the `ecelinux` servers.

Also the very first time you log into the `ecelinux` servers you will see
a pop up dialog box in the lower right-hand corner which says _Setting up
SSH host ecelinux-XX.ece.cornell.edu (details) Initializing..._. It might
take up to a minute for everything to be setup; please be patient! Once
the pop up dialog box goes away and you see _SSH:
ecelinux-XX.ece.cornell.edu_ in the lower left-hand corner of VS Code
then you know you are connected to the `ecelinux` servers.

The final step is to make sure your extensions for the Verilog HDL are
also installed on the server. Choose _View > Extensions_ from the
menubar. Use the "Search Extensions in Marketplace" to search for the
same extensions that we installed earlier. Instead of saying _Install_ it
should now say _Install in SSH: ecelinux-XX.ece.cornell.edu_. Install the
extensions on the `ecelinux` servers. You only need to do this once, and
then next time this extension will already be installed on the `ecelinux`
servers.

### 4.4. Using VS Code

VS Code includes an integrated file explorer which makes it very
productive to browse and open files. Choose _View > Explorer_ from the
menubar, and then click on _Open Folder_. VS Code will then ask you to
_Open File Or Folder_ with a default of `/home/netid`. Click _OK_.

You might see a pop-up which asks you _Do you trust the authors of the
files in this folder?_ Since you will only be browsing your own files
on the `ecelinux` server, it is fine to choose _Yes, I trust the
authors_.

This will reload VS Code, and you should now you will see a file explore
in the left sidebar. You can easily browse your directory hierarchy, open
files by clicking on them, create new files, and delete files.

VS Code includes an integrated terminal which will give you access to the
Linux command line on the `ecelinux` servers. Choose _Terminal > New
Terminal_ from the menubar. You should see the same kind of Linux command
line prompt that you saw when using either PowerShell or Mac Terminal.

If you see a course number for a course other than ECE 6745 in your
prompt, then stop! This means you likely have sourced the setup script
for a different course. You must fix this before you can work on this
course. Exit VS Code, follow the instructions in Section 2.3, and then
try connecting with VS Code again.

The very first thing you need to do after logging into the `ecelinux`
servers is source the setup script for this course. This will ensure your
environment is setup with everything you need for working on the
projects. Enter the following command on the command line:

```bash
% source setup-ece6745.sh
```

Again, you should not enter the `%` character. You should now see a blue
`ECE 6745` in your prompt which means your environment is setup for the
course. See the final section of this tutorial for more on how to
automatically source the setup script every time you log into the
`ecelinux` servers.

To experiment with VS Code, we will first grab a text file using the
`wget` command. The next tutorial discusses this command in more detail.
Type the following command in the VS Code integrated terminal.

```bash
% wget http://www.csl.cornell.edu/courses/ece6745/overview.txt
```

You can open a file in the integrated text editor using the `code`
command like this:

```bash
% code overview.txt
```

The following figure shows what VS Code should look like if you have
sourced the course setup script and opened the `overview.txt` file.
Notice how the `overview.txt` file opened in a new tab at the top and the
terminal remains at the bottom. This enables you to have easy access to
editing files and the Linux command line at the same time.

![](img/tut00-vscode-connected.png)

We highly recommend turnning on auto save so you don't forget to save
your work. You can do this by choosing _File > Auto Save_ from the
menubar.

### 4.5. Turning off Microsoft Copilot

This course uses an "AI as TA" policy, which means students can use AI
for similar questions they might ask a TA. Microsoft Copilot enables AI
to write code automatically for students. Since a student would never ask
a TA to write code for them, using Microsoft Copilot is a violation of
the Academic Integrity Policy and prohibited in this course. Students
will not have access to AI during the prelim/final exams nor the Verilog
exam, so students which violate this policy are unlikely to succeed in
these assessments.

There are two steps turning off AI functionality in VS Code:

 - If you have already installed the Copilot extensions, you need to
   first uninstall the Copilot and Copilot Chat extensions

 - Choose _View > Command Palette_ from the menubar. Enter the following
   command in the command palette:

    Chat: Hide AI Features

If this does not work, you may need to uninstall VS Code and resinstall
it from scratch. More information can be found here:

 - <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/supporting/FAQ#_can-i-disable-ai-functionality-in-vs-code>

You should also of course uninstall any other AI extensions such as
Cline, Roo Code, etc.

### 4.6. Troubleshooting Remote Access via VS Code

There may be issues where sometimes VS Code just keeps asking you for
your password or VS Code just hangs when you try and connect to the
`ecelinux` servers. This might mean VS Code is getting wedged. You can
definitely ask the course staff to help, but you can also try to fix it
on your own.

You might be out of space on `ecelinux`. Student home directories have a
quota of 10G so you might need to delete some files to free up some
space. How can you delete this directory if you cannot use VS Code to
access the `ecelinux` servers? You can use PowerShell or Mac Terminal to
log into the `ecelinux` servers (see Section 3). Then use `quota` to see
how much space you are using and you can also use `du -sh *` to see how
much space each directory is taking up. If you are over 10G you will need
to free up some space. You might need to delete the `tmp/trash`
directory.

Another thing to try is to kill the VS Code server on the host. Choose
_View > Command Palette_ from the menubar. Enter the following command in
the command palette:

    Remote-SSH: Kill VS Code Server on Host...

You can also try (especially if the `code` command is not working for
you) deleting the `.vscode-server` directory on the sever. Again, how can
you delete this directory if you cannot use VS Code to access the
`ecelinux` servers? You can use PowerShell or Mac Terminal to log into
the `ecelinux` servers (see Section 3).

Once you have gained access to the Linux command line on the `ecelinux`
servers using either PowerShell or Mac Terminal, then you can delete the
`.vscode-server` directory like this:

```bash
% rm -rf .vscode-server
```

Be very careful with the `rm` command since it deletes files permanently!

Note that using the `Remote-SSH: Add new SSH host...` option does not
always seem to work on Microsoft Windows OS laptops/workstations. This is
why we recommend just using `Remote-SSH: Connect Current Window to
Host...` directly.

VS Code can sometimes "cache" your `.bashrc`. This means if you modfiy
your `.bashrc`, log out, and log back in the changes to your `.bashrc`
will not be reflected. If you modify your `.bashrc` we recommend: (1)
using _Remote-SSH: Kill VS Code Server on Host..._ as described above;
(2) close all instances of VS Code; (3) either use PowerShell or Mac
Terminal to remove the `.vscode-server` directory as described above; and
(4) reconnect VS Code to `ecelinux`.

Sometimes VS Code can take a very long time to save a file. This is
usually because VS Code is trying to auto-format the file on the
`ecelinux` servers. To turn off auto-formatting, open the VS Code
settings menu. On Windows OS, choose _File > Preferences > Settings_ from
the menubar. On Mac OS X, choose _Code > Preferences > Settings_ from the
menubar. Click on _Text Editor_ and then _Formatting_. Make sure _Format
On Save_ is not checked.

5. Remote Access via Microsoft Remote Desktop
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will primarily use VS Code for working at the terminal, developing our
hardware, and debugging our designs. However, we need to use a different
remote accesss option if we want to run a Linux application which has a
graphical user interface (GUI). We will be using the Microsoft Remote
Desktop application to log into the `ecelinux` servers to provide us a
"virtual desktop" which we can then use to interact with Linux GUI
applications.

### 5.1. Installing Microsoft Remote Desktop on Your Laptop/Workstation

Start by installing the Microsoft Remote Desktop application. On Windows,
simply use the _Start Menu_ to search for _Microsoft Remote Desktop_. On
Mac OS X, download Microsoft Remote Desktop from the App Store:

 - <https://apps.apple.com/us/app/windows-app/id1295203466>

### 5.2. Starting and Configuring Microsoft Remote Desktop from Windows

Start Microsoft Remote Desktop. **For the _Computer_ you must choose the
same `ecelinux` server you selected in Section 1; do _not_ just use
`ecelinux.ece.cornell.edu`.** Then click on _Connect_. You may see a
message like this:

```
The remote computer could not be authenticated due to problems with its
security certificate. It may be unsafe to proceed.
```

If you see this message then take the following steps:

 - Click _Don't ask me again for connections to this computer_
 - Click _Yes_

This should launch a "virtual desktop" on `ecelinux`. You will need to
enter your NetID and password in the xrdp login.

### 5.3. Starting and Configuring Microsoft Remote Desktop from Mac OS X

Start Microsoft Remote Desktop and _Connections > Add PC_ from the menu.
**For the PC name or hostname you must choose the same `ecelinux` server
you selected in Section 1; do _not_ just use
`ecelinux.ece.cornell.edu`.** Then use the following setup:

 - Click the _Credential_ or _User Account_ drop down and choose _Add Credentials_ or _Add User Account_
    + Username: _netid@cornell.edu_ (must have _@cornell.edu_ at end!)
    + Password: NetID password
    + Friendly name: _ecelinux_
 - _Display_ tab
    + Uncheck _Start session in full screen_
 - _Devices & Audio_ tab
    + Uncheck _Printers_ and _Smart cards_
 - Click _Add_

To log into `ecelinux` double click on the corresponding entry in
Microsoft Remote Desktop. You may see a message like this:

```
Your are connecting to the RDP host ... The certificate couldn't be
verified back to a root certificate. Your connection may not be
secure. Do you want to continue?
```

If you see this message then take the following steps:

 - Click _Show Certificate_
 - Click _Always trutst XRDP when connecting ..._
 - Click _Continue_

This should launch a "virtual desktop" on `ecelinux`.

### 5.4. Using Microsoft Remote Desktop

To use Linux GUI Applications you need to source another setup script in
your VS Code terminal like this:

```bash
% source setup-gui.sh
```

If you see an error that the script cannot find a running instance of
Xvnc this means you have not connected to your selected `ecelinux` server
using Microsoft Remote Desktop. You cannot source `setup-gui.sh` in your
`.bashrc`. It will not work.

Assuming there are no errors, you can now try starting a Linux GUI
application. Try running the `xclock` program in your VS Code terminal.

```bash
% xclock
```

You should see an analog clock pop up in Microsoft Remote Desktop. Close
the analog clock window.

![](img/tut00-xrdp.png)

6. Sourcing Course Setup Script with Auto Setup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The previous sections have demonstrated how to remotely access the
`ecelinux` servers, get to the Linux command line, and source the course
setup script. *Again, you must source the course setup script before
doing any work related to this course!* The course setup script
configures everything so you have the right environment to work on the
projects.

Since it can be tedious to always remember to source the course setup
script, you can also use auto setup which will automatically source the
course setup for you when you open a terminal. **Note that you should
only do this if ECE 6745 is the only course you are taking this semester
which is using `ecelinux`!** If you are taking more than one course which
is using `ecelinux`, then you will need to manually source the setup
script when you are working on this course. Enter the following command
on the command line to use auto setup:

```bash
 % source setup-ece6745.sh --enable-auto-setup
```

Then you must kill the VS Code server on the host. Choose _View > Command
Palette_ from the menubar. Enter the following command in the command
palette:

    Remote-SSH: Kill VS Code Server on Host...

Then connect again by choosing _View > Command Palette_ from the menubar.
Enter the following command in the command palette:

    Remote-SSH: Connect Current Window to Host...

You should see `ECE 6745` in the prompt meaning your environment is
automatically setup for the course. If at anytime you need to disable
auto setup you can use the following command:

```bash
 % source setup-ece6745.sh --disable-auto-setup
```

Again, if for any reason running the setup script prevents you from using
tools for another course, you cannot use the auto setup. You will need to
run the setup script manually every time you want to work on a project
for this course.
